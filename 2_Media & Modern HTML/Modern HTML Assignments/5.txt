5. Write a short note on tab index.

Ans: The "tabindex" attribute in HTML is used to define the order in which elements receive focus when the user navigates through a webpage using the "Tab" key on their keyboard. This attribute assigns a numerical value to an element, indicating its position in the tab order. 
There are two additional options available for tabindex:

1. tabindex="0" -  this option allows elements that are not usually able to be focused via the keyboard to become focusable. This value of tabindex is particularly beneficial.

2. tabindex="-1" - this option enables elements that are not typically focusable to receive focus programmatically, such as through JavaScript, or as the target of links.
